### How to run the API

Make sure you have Ruby and Rails installed on your computer.

Clone the repo and enter the project folder

```
git clone https://github.com/smartguy205/rails-master
cd rails-master
```

Execute migrations

```
rails db:migrate
```

Run the web server

```
rails server
```

That's it. Now you can use the api, i.e.

```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/articles
```
